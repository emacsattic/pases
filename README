 Pases
=======

Pases is a packaging and system definition system for Emacs.

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

To begin using Pases, unpack the distribution to a directory. We will
assume that you have unpacked it to ``~/.pases.d/pases-0.2/``. Then
add the following to your .emacs file::

  (load (expand-file-name "~/.pases.d/pases-0.2/pases"))

That is all you need. Either restart Emacs or evaluate that line.

Using
~~~~~

You can install packages with::

  M-x pases:install-package

and remove packages with::

  M-x pases:uninstall-package

These commands will prompt for a package file to install, or a package
name to uninstall.

You can temporarily enable or disable packages as well::

  M-x pases:disable-package

and::

  M-x pases:enable-package

Getting packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Included in the distribution are a number of Makefiles for building
packages (under the systems/ directory). From a directory, use make to
build a package. Alternately, there are pre-build binary packages
available from the Pases web site.
