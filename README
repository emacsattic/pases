 Pases
=======

Pases is a packaging and system definition system for Emacs.

Features
~~~~~~~~

For users:

- Installation of bundled software from local package files.
- No modification of .emacs file to add to load-path, etc., when
  installing a new emacs package.
- Separation of compiled .elc files according to Emacs variant and
  major version.

For packagers:
- Multi-file packages easily handled.
- Easy specification of package loading order.
- Fine-tuned selection of which Elisp source files to enable and
  compile based on any properties of Emacs installation (e.g., Xemacs
  only files, different sources for GNU emacs 22 and 23, etc.)
- No modification to original Emacs source is necessary to create
  packages.
- Generation of autoloads via pases.
- Self-hosting (pases is itself a pases package).

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

To begin, bootsrap pases by evaluating the following code in Emacs::

  (let ((buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously
  	       "http://launchpad.net/pases/trunk/0.2/+download/pases-bootstrap.el")))
    (save-excursion
      (set-buffer buffer)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (re-search-forward "^$" nil 'move)
      (eval-region (point) (point-max))
      (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))

You are now ready to install your first pases package, pases itself.
Download the pases-0.2.pases distribution from:
http://launchpad.net/pases/trunk/0.2/+download/pases-0.2.pases, and,
in Emacs, run::

  M-x pases:install-package

Choose the pases-0.2.pases package. Pases should install, compile, and
enable itself. Finally, add the following to your ``.emacs`` file::

  (load (expand-file-name "~/.pases.d/pases-0.2/pases-load"))

That is all you need. You do not need to restart emacs, because the
pases-bootstrap loaded all necessary code. You can install any needed
packages.

Further usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install packages with::

  M-x pases:install-package

and remove packages with::

  M-x pases:uninstall-package

These commands will prompt for a package file to install, or a package
name to uninstall.

You can temporarily enable or disable packages as well::

  M-x pases:disable-package

and::

  M-x pases:enable-package

Getting packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Included in the distribution are a number of Makefiles for building
packages (under the systems/ directory). From a directory, use make to
build a package. Alternately, there are pre-build binary packages
available from:
