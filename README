* Pases

Pases is a packaging and system definition system for Emacs.

* Installing

To begin using Pases, unpack the distribution to a directory. We will
assume that you have unpacked it to ~/share/emacs/pases-0.1/. Then add
the following to your .emacs file:

(load (expand-file-name "~/share/emacs/pases-0.1/pases.el"))

That is all you need. Either restart Emacs or evaluate that line.

* Using

You can install packages with:

M-x pases:install-package

and remove packages with:

M-X pases:uninstall-package

These commands will prompt for a package file to install, or a package
name to uninstall.

* Getting packages

Included in the distribution are a number of Makefiles for building
packages (under the systems/ directory). From a directory, use make to
build a package. Alternately, there may be pre-build binary packages
available from the Pases web site.
